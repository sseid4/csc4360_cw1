# Image Assets

For this tutorial, you'll need to add two images:
- image1.png (or any image format like jpg, jpeg)
- image2.png (or any image format like jpg, jpeg)

You can use any two different images you like. For example:
- A sun and moon image for day/night toggle
- A smiley and sad face
- Any two different icons or pictures

Place your images in this folder and make sure they're named:
- image1.png
- image2.png

Or update the code to match your image names.
